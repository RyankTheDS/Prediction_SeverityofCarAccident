# Prediction of the Severity of Car Accidents
To reduce the number of unnecessary fatalities on the road and the economic impact of car
accidents on Brazil, we used a dataset from the Detran (Department of Transit)
database that records all the car accidents that occurred in Brazil in the year 2020 [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raphaelmarconato/detran-accidents-2020). By using this
dataset, we developed a **Supervised Machine Learning** application that predicts the severity of car accidents.

## Our Approach
1. Business Understanding 
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Split Dataset (Before Upsampling)
5. Model Training (Before Upsampling)
6. Model Validation (Before Upsampling)
7. Upsampled the Dataset before Splitting
8. Split Dataset (After Upsampling)
9. Model Training (After Upsampling)
10. Model Validation (After Upsampling)
11. Compared Performance of Models before and after upsampling 
12. Determined that Models Performed better after Upsampling
13. Selection of the Best Model (Random Forest) and Model Testing

## The ML Models/Algorithms Used for this Assignment
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Logistic Regression
4. K Nearest Neighbour

## How to run the program
1. Ensure that you have Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook installed on your device
2. Unzip the zipped file and ensure that the dataset â€˜si_env-2020â€™ is in the same folder location as the .ipynb file.
3. The .ipynb file makes use of several packages so please ensure that you have installed all the packages used in the file.
4. Execute all the commands in the file. After executing the last code segment, you should see a Tkinter window at the bottom of the screen.
5. Click on the Tkinter window and test out the Car Accident Severity Predictor Program.

Hope you enjoy testing out our code!! ðŸ˜€
